An overview of who I am, and the projects I have made:

Hey! My name is Avi Saraiya. I'm a Level II Software Engineering and Management Student at McMaster University. Currently, I am looking for a CO-OP - preferably a 4, 8, or 12 month term.
I'm always on the lookout for a fun and interesting project to do, and while this is a never-ending quest, here has been my journey so far.

Project:     Byte Brawl - A Combat Video Game built using Pygame<br>
Description: Programmed a combat video game with animations and realistic game physics using Python.<br>
             Added functionality that supports two player gameplay to appeal to a greater audience.<br>
             Utilized the principles of OOP for code reusability and thoroughly modularized the code.<br>

Project:     Rattlesnake - A C Implementation of the Boardgame "Chameleon"<br>
Description: Implemented the core mechanics of the "Chameleon" board game in C, including player actions, turn-based gameplay, and dynamic game state management.<br>
             Created an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) to enhance user experience, allowing for easy interaction and game control.<br>
             Integrated both the game logic and GUI elements, ensuring smooth performance and providing users with a visually engaging and interactive experience.<br>

Project:     Baby Names Data Analyzer - A Bash Command Line Utility<br>
Description: Created a command line utility using Bash that analyzed all baby names in the US over 143 years and output the frequency of the entered name in a specific gender category.<br>
             Implemented an algorithm to rank these names in terms of the total names in the available gender categories.<br>
             Utilized flag comprehension to differentiate between arguments, including usage and help flags.<br>

Project:     Java Quiz Application<br>
Description: Built a Java-based quiz application with a graphical user interface (GUI), featuring multiple frames to guide users through the quiz, including a starting frame, rule display, question display, and final score results.<br>
             Designed dynamic question navigation, a countdown timer for each question, and options for users to select answers, ensuring an interactive and time-sensitive quiz experience.<br>
             Developed a score tracking system that displays the user's final score at the end of the quiz, with an option to retry, resetting the quiz to the starting frame for a new attempt.<br>

Project:     Tic Tac Toe - A Dynamic Java Implementation<br>
Description: Enabled flexible tic tac toe gameplay by allowing players to choose between human vs. human, human vs. computer, or computer vs. computer modes.<br>
             Allowed users to customize the game board by defining the number of rows and columns, as well as specifying how many counters are needed in a line to win.<br>
             Implemented game logic that dynamically adjusts to different grid sizes and winning conditions while ensuring smooth interaction for both human and computer players.<br>
