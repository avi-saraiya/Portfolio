# Portfolio

Hey! My name is Avi Saraiya. I'm a Level III Software Engineering and Management Student at McMaster University. Currently, I am looking for a CO-OP in the varied domains of both Cybersecurity and Business, owing to my diverse skillset.
I'm always on the lookout for a fun and interesting project to do, and while this is a never-ending quest, here's my journey so far:

## Insurance Claims Analytics Dashboard
This project analyzes over 1,000 medical insurance records to identify trends in charges by age, region, BMI, and smoking status.
The dataset was cleaned and transformed using Power Query, then visualized in Power BI with KPIs and interactive charts.
The final dashboard provides insights into key cost drivers and supports data-driven decision-making in insurance pricing.

## Active Directory Security Lab & Threat Simulation (Homelab)
Designed and implemented a self-contained Active Directory lab environment for hands-on learning of domain management and network configuration.
Simulated real-world attacks, including brute force attempts, to understand security vulnerabilities and user account protection.
Leveraged Splunk for telemetry collection and analysis, gaining insights into failed and successful authentication events.
Deployed Atomic Red Team to test detection capabilities and identify gaps in monitoring and alerting.
Documented all procedures and results to create a reproducible, educational cybersecurity lab environment. (in progress)

## AI Tag Scan 
Created a fullstack application where the user can upload the image of their clothing tag, and recieve tips on how to better care for the clothes based on the information found on the tag.<br>
Used a Google Lens API to analyze the clothing tag image.<br>
Passed the clothing tag info into a Google gemini-1.5-flash model to recieve the clothing care recommendations.<br>
Used the react JavaScript library for the frontend, Python for the backend, and the flask library for handling requests between the front and back ends.

## AI Recipe Recommender
Created an application that allows the user to take pictures of ingredients, and receive recipe recommendations based on the uploaded images.<br>
Used the cv2 python library for computer vision, ResNet deep learning architecture for image processing, and a gpt-3.5 model to give recommendations.

## Byte Brawl - A Combat Video Game built using Pygame
Programmed a combat video game with animations and realistic game physics using Python.<br>
Added functionality that supports two player gameplay to appeal to a greater audience.<br>
Utilized the principles of OOP for code reusability and thoroughly modularized the code.

## Google Doc Table Interpreter
Fetched a given webpageâ€™s content using the requests library and parsed the HTML with BeautifulSoup to extract plain text.<br>
Extracted grid data from the text using a regular expression pattern and stored it in lists.<br>
Generated and printed a grid of characters by sorting the coordinates and mapping them to the corresponding characters from the parsed data.

## Rattlesnake - A C Implementation of the Boardgame "Chameleon"
Implemented the core mechanics of the "Chameleon" board game in C, including player actions, turn-based gameplay, and dynamic game state management.<br>
Created an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) to enhance user experience, allowing for easy interaction and game control.<br>
Integrated both the game logic and GUI elements, ensuring smooth performance and providing users with a visually engaging and interactive experience.

## Baby Names Data Analyzer - A Bash Command Line Utility
Created a command line utility using Bash that analyzed all baby names in the US over 143 years and output the frequency of the entered name in a specific gender category.<br>
             Implemented an algorithm to rank these names in terms of the total names in the available gender categories.<br>
             Utilized flag comprehension to differentiate between arguments, including usage and help flags

## Java Quiz Application
Built a Java-based quiz application with a graphical user interface (GUI), featuring multiple frames to guide users through the quiz, including a starting frame, rule display, question display, and final score results.<br>
Designed dynamic question navigation, a countdown timer for each question, and options for users to select answers, ensuring an interactive and time-sensitive quiz experience.<br>
Developed a score tracking system that displays the user's final score at the end of the quiz, with an option to retry, resetting the quiz to the starting frame for a new attempt

## Tic Tac Toe - A Dynamic Java Implementation<br>
Enabled flexible tic tac toe gameplay by allowing players to choose between human vs. human, human vs. computer, or computer vs. computer modes.<br>
Allowed users to customize the game board by defining the number of rows and columns, as well as specifying how many counters are needed in a line to win.<br>
Implemented game logic that dynamically adjusts to different grid sizes and winning conditions while ensuring smooth interaction for both human and computer players.
