An overview of who I am, and the projects I have made:
Hey! My name is Avi Saraiya. I'm a Level II Software Engineering and Management Student at McMaster University. Currently, I am looking for a CO-OP - preferably a 4, 8, or 12 month term.
I'm always on the lookout for a fun and interesting project to do, and while this is a never-ending quest, here has been my journey so far.

Project:     Byte Brawl - A Combat Video Game built using Pygame
Description: Programmed a combat video game with animations and realistic game physics using Python.
             Added functionality that supports two player gameplay to appeal to a greater audience.
             Utilized the principles of OOP for code reusability and thoroughly modularized the code.

Project:     Rattlesnake - A C Implementation of the Boardgame "Chameleon"
Description: Implemented the core mechanics of the "Chameleon" board game in C, including player actions, turn-based gameplay, and dynamic game state management. 
             Created an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) to enhance user experience, allowing for easy interaction and game control. 
             Integrated both the game logic and GUI elements, ensuring smooth performance and providing users with a visually engaging and interactive experience.

Project:     Baby Names Data Analyzer - A Bash Command Line Utility
Description: Created a command line utility using Bash that analyzed all baby names in the US over 143 years and output the frequency of the entered name in a specific gender category.
             Implemented an algorithm to rank these names in terms of the total names in the available gender categories.
             Utilized flag comprehension to differentiate between arguments, including usage and help flags.

Project:     Java Quiz Application
Description: Built a Java-based quiz application with a graphical user interface (GUI), featuring multiple frames to guide users through the quiz, including a starting frame, rule display, question display, and final score results. 
             Designed dynamic question navigation, a countdown timer for each question, and options for users to select answers, ensuring an interactive and time-sensitive quiz experience. 
             Developed a score tracking system that displays the user's final score at the end of the quiz, with an option to retry, resetting the quiz to the starting frame for a new attempt.

Project:     Tic Tac Toe - A Dynamic Java Implementation
Description: Enabled flexible tic tac toe gameplay by allowing players to choose between human vs. human, human vs. computer, or computer vs. computer modes. 
             Allowed users to customize the game board by defining the number of rows and columns, as well as specifying how many counters are needed in a line to win. 
             Implemented game logic that dynamically adjusts to different grid sizes and winning conditions while ensuring smooth interaction for both human and computer players.
